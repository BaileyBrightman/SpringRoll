##Documentation##

[API Documentation](http://cloudkidstudio.github.io/CloudKidFramework/)

##Installation##

CloudKid Framework can be install using Bower.

```bash
bower install cloudkid-framework
```

##Displays

The Framework is inherently canvas-rendering agnostic. We support two different rendering display plugins for [CreateJS](http://createjs.com/) and [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/). In addition, there is a generic display for rendering using [Context2d](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-2dcontext-20140821/) or [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/). An Application built with the Framework can support all there displays methods simultaneously.
